# Walking-Robot
The repository consists of codes for the walking robot simulation project:
1) Stability Traingle (which shows if a robot is moving stably)
2) X and Y curve of the leg trajectory
3) Generation of Fourier courve
4) Co-Sim file

During my research internship at Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology,
I worked on gait generation, conceptual design and dynamic simulation of a quadruped robot.
The work included designing the mechanism of robot leg, gait generation for static and dynamic stability, 
trajectory planning of the end point, fourier approximation of the trajectory for periodic motion, 
acceleration and deceleration of the leg using a pseudo-time variable, inverse kinematics, 
motion simulation and compliance modeling in Adams View. Stable walking,turning and trotting gaits were achieved
by analysis of stability triangles using MATLAB considering time period, duty factor,
phase difference between ipsilateral and contralateral legs.
